"""Adversary features.

Registered under the feature's own name, namespaced - `adversary:Climber`. See
features/weapons.py for why the namespace exists. A stat block in
`adversaries/*.json` names its features and they resolve here, exactly the way a
character sheet names its domain cards.

## Why the Jagged Knife passives are dismissed rather than left unimplemented

None of the three below runs any code, and none is `unimplemented`, because
`unimplemented` means work nobody has done - and these were assessed. Two of
them are dismissed as **insignificant** rather than as having no effect at all,
which is the distinction that state exists for: both really do swap in a bigger
damage die, so "it cannot matter" would be false, but the size of the swap is
what settles it.

The reason it settles it is the shape of Daggerheart's damage rules. Damage
becomes marked HP through **threshold bands**, not linearly - a hit marks 1, 2 or
3 HP depending on which side of the Major and Severe thresholds it lands. A point
or two of expected damage moves a roll within a band far more often than across
one, so an expected-damage bump this small is very nearly invisible in the only
number that reaches the fight.
